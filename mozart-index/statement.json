  "statement": "All the beautiful compositions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ($1756$-$1791$) are chronologically contained in what is known as a \"K\u00f6chel catalogue\". In K\u00f6chel catalogue, each piece he composed is assigned an index from $1$ to $626$ (the first piece is a harpsichord piece Mozart in his childhood composed, and the last piece is the incomplete requiem). For example, K.$331$ is his Piano Sonata No.$11$, and its third movement is well-known for its name \"Turkish March\" (Alla Turca). By the way, the problem writer is now practicing its first movement, \"Andante Grazioso\", and is performing it with some other French Suite pieces by Bach at the end-of-semester recital (Solo Music St Andrews, $19:00$ at Gifford Room, Laidlaw Music Centre), so please let me know if anyone is ever interested, at ka203@st-andrews.ac.uk or on my Instagram: @kay.liechtenstein .\n\nGoing back to the problem, it is known that we can roughly esimate how old Mozart was when he composed a piece by having a look at its K\u00f6chel index. That is, divide the index by $25$, and then add $10$ to it. \n\nLet's take my top favourite piece Piano Concerto No.$22$ as an example. Its K\u00f6chel index is K.$482$. Thus, rough estimation of his age at the time of composition is $482 / 25 + 10 = 29.28$. Actually, this concerto was known to be composed at the age of $29$ in Vienna. Pretty good estimator, although it does not work very well occasionally. \n\nIn this problem, you are required to output the estimated age of Mozart given a K\u00f6chel index $N$ as an input. Note that, you are also required to round an answer down so that it is reported as an integer.",

      "input": "265",
      "output": "20",
      "explanation": "K.$265$ is the \"Twelve Variations in C Major\" (a.k.a. \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"), and this was composed when he was actually $25$ in Vienna. On the other hand, calculation shows $265 / 25 + 10 = 20.6$. Not very accurate, but it still works.\n"

    {
      "input": "626",
      "output": "35",
      "explanation": "This is his incomplete requiem, \"Requiem in D minor\". $626 / 25 + 10 = 35.04$ and the output is $35$ since you round it down. For your information, Mozart died at the age of $35$. "
