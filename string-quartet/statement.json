  "statement": "Kay has $4$ strings and lays them on an X-axis. String $i$ has its left end at $x = l_i$ and right end at $x = r_i$. Now, find the length of line segment where all the $4$ strings are laid.",
  "constraints": "$0 \\leq l_i \\lt r_i \\leq 10$.\n\nAll the input values are given as integers.",
  "subtasks": [],
  "input": "The input contains $4$ lines, each of which has $l_i$ and $r_i$.",
  "output": "Output a single integer, the length of line segment where all $4$ strings overlap.",
  "examples": [

      "input": "0 8\n3 10\n5 8\n1 9",
      "output": "3",
      "explanation": "It is the line segment between $x = 5$ and $x = 8$ that satisfies the condition. Hence the length is $8 - 5 = 3$.\n"
