## Problem Statement 

You are organising a programming competition platform. For each submission, you would like to assign a unique ID that consits of $n$ letters. Each letter can be any small Latin letter, large Latin letter, or decimal number ($i.e.$, a-z, A-Z, $0$-$9$). How many possible IDs can you produce? Note that, because the answer can become astronomically large, your task is to output the answer $mod$ $10^{9} + 7$. In other word, output the remainder of the answer divided by $10^{9} + 7$.

## Constraints

$1 \leq n \leq 10^{12}$.

### Subtask 1 (.2)

$1 \leq n \lt 10^{5}$.

### Subtask 2 (.8)

$10^{5} \leq n \leq 10^{12}$.

## Input

The input contains one integer, $n$.

## Output

Output the answer.
