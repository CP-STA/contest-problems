  "statement": "You are organising a programming competition platform. For each submission, you would like to assign a unique ID that consits of $n$ letters. Each letter can be any small Latin letter, large Latin letter, or decimal number ($i.e.$, a-z, A-Z, $0$-$9$). How many possible IDs can you produce? Note that, because the answer can become astronomically large, your task is to output the answer $mod$ $10^{9} + 7$. In other word, output the remainder of the answer divided by $10^{9} + 7$.",
