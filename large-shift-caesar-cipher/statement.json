  "statement": "You are given a key $k$ and a string $s$ consisting of $n$ small Latin letters. Your task is to perform the following operation on each letter in $s$:\n\nyou change it to the letter which is $k$ letters ahead of the original letter. For example, if $k = 2$ and the letter is \"b\", you change \"b\" to \"d\". In case you come to \"z\" and still have to move the letters, go back to \"a\". For example, if $k = 4$ and the letter is \"y\", this is changed to \"c\". \n\nNote that, if $k$ is negative, you change the letter to $k$ letters behind the original letter.",
