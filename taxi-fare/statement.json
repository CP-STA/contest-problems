  "statement": "In Tokyo, initial taxi fare is $X$ yen. Taxi fare increases by every kilometer by $Y$ yen. \nOne day, Kay has moved $Z$ meters by taxi. How much should he pay for the fare?\n\nIn the first example, taxi fare starts at $410$ yen. The fare increases by $400$ yen at the point where Kay has moved $1000$m (= $1$km). Hence the total fare is $810$ yen.\n\nIn the second example, taxi fare starts at $0$ yen. Because Kay travelled by less than a kilometer, the fare never increases. Hence the total fare is $0$ yen.",
