  "statement": "Given an integer $X$ and $n$ integers $a_{1}$, ..., $a_{n}$, find the greatest common multiple of all the elements in $a$ which is smaller than or equal to $X$. If there is no such answer, output $-1$ instead.\n\nNote that, common multiple of $a$ is the number which can be divided by any element in $a$. Your task is to find the greatest one amongst several possible (or zero) common multiples.",
  "constraints": "$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$, $1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$, $1 \\leq X \\leq 10^{9}$.",

  "input": "The first line of input contains two integers, $n$ and $X$.\nThe second line contains $n$ integers separated by single spaces in between.",
  "output": "Output the answer.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "3 100\n2 3 5",
      "output": "90",
      "explanation": "In this example, common multiples of $a$ which are smaller than or equal to $X = 100$ are $(30, 60, 90)$. The greatest common multiple of $a$ here is therefore $90$.\n"

      "input": "4 10\n2 5 8 9",
      "output": "-1",
      "explanation": "In this example, the least common multiple is $360$. This indicates that there's no common multiple that is smaller than or equal to $10$. For this reason, output $-1$. "
