## Problem Statement 

One day, Deyao was spoken to by his friend Kay who's studying in the medical school. He seems to have just received his mid-semester assessment (MSA) result which he said was okay. However, he looks very curious about how well he performed in comparison to the entire class. Although Kay doesn't have the full list of his colleagues' scores in the entire class, he has brought the list of scores of his $N$ friends and gives it to him as a sequence $A = (a_1, a_2, a_3, ... , a_n)$. Now, he asks Deyao to calculate the $95$% confidence interval (CI) of the entire class based on $A$ using a normal distribution.

Later, Deyao gave him back the CI of MSA scores of the entire class calculated based on $A$ that Kay provided him with, but Kay looks a bit skeptical (mainly because of his ignorance). According to him, He wants consider $(N-L+1)$ different CIs based on subarrays $A_1$, $A_2$, ... $A_{N-L}$, where $A_i = (a_i, a_{i+1},...,a_{i+L-1})$. 

Now Kay wants to know for each score $0\le k\le 1000$, how many subarrays $A_i$ include the score $k$ in their CI. Note we consider $k$ to be within the CI if and only if it is greater than or equal to the lower border of the CI and less than or equal to the upper border of the CI.

Below are reminders of the formulas you can use to calculate the CI. 

For the sequence $X$ of length $n$, lower and upper borders of $95$% CI can be calculated using the following formulae:

lower border $= μ - σ × z_{\frac{α}{2}}$, upper border $= μ + σ × z_{\frac{α}{2}}$

where $μ$ is the mean of $X$, $σ$ is the standard deviation of $X$, and $z_{\frac{α}{2}}$ is the confidence level value which is equal to $1.96$ this time.

Standard deviation $σ$ for the sequence $X$ of length $n$ can be calculated in a following way:

$σ = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (X_i - μ)^{2}}{n}}$.

## Constraints

MSA score is in a range of $0$ to $1000$ all in integer.

### Subtask 1 (.2)

$1 \leq L \lt N \leq 100$.

### Subtask 2 (.8)

$1 \leq L \lt N \leq 10^{5}$.

## Input

In the first line of input, there're two integers, $N$ and $L$.
In the second line of input, you're given a sequence $A$ of length $N$.

## Output

Output $1001$ integers in a single line. The $i$-th element $(0 \leq i \leq 1000)$ in an output denotes how many times the score $i$ is included in the CIs.

### Explanation

Deyao is required to calculate $(5 - 3 + 1) = 3$ $95$% CIs:

$(1)$: Deyao calculates the CI of $A_1$. For this sequence, $μ = \frac{(725 + 661 + 880)}{3} = 755.3333333333334$. $σ = \sqrt(\frac{(725 - 755.3333333333334)^{2} + (661 - 755.3333333333334)^2 + (880 - 755.3333333333334)^{2}}{3}) = 91.94321919291033$. Thus, lower border $= 755.3333333333334 - 91.94321919291033 × 1.96 = 575.1246237152291$, and upper border $= 755.3333333333334 + 91.94321919291033 × 1.96 = 935.5420429514377$. 

$(2)$: Likewise, lower and upper borders for the sequence $A_2$ are $574.9048135198427$ and $1113.761853146824$ respectively.

$(3)$: Likewise, lower and upper borders for the sequence $A_3$ are $432.2210787920378$ and $1178.445587874629$ respectively.

Because Deyao is only asked to give a list of counts from $0$ to $1000$, he can ignore the count of scores from $1001$ to $1113$ in the second sequence and from $1001$ to $1178$.
