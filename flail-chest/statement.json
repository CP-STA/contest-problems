  "statement": "Human body has $12$ pairs of ribs. Rib cage forms the chest cavity, and protects important organs inside. \n\nBecause of fragility, ribs are prone to fracture by trauma. Flail chest is a medical term that describes the specific rib fracture pattern, and is defined as follows: the rib fractures where $3$ or more adjacent ribs are broken.\n\nYou will receive a string $S$ of length $12$ each letter of which is either \"o\" (intact) or \"x\" (fractured) that you collected from your patient. $i$-th letter states the status of $i$-th rib $(1 \\leq i \\leq 12)$. Your task is to judge whether their fracture pattern is categorised as flail chest or not.",

  "input": "The input consists of a single string, $S$.",

      "explanation": "The $2$nd, $3$rd, and $4$th ribs are broken. Because there're $3$ consecutive affected ribs, it's categorised as flail chest.\n"
