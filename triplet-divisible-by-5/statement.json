  "statement": "You are given a list of non-negative numbers, $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$. You want to choose $i$, $j$, $k$ $(1 \\leq i \\lt j \\lt k \\leq n)$ in such a way that $a_i + a_j + a_k$ is divisible by $5$. How many possible pairs of $(i, j, k)$ are there in total?\n\nIn the first example, $(1, 2, 3)$ is the only set of indices that satisfies the condition. Hence the answer is $1$.\n\nIn the second example, $(1, 2, 3)$, $(1, 2, 4)$, $(1, 3, 5)$, and $(1, 4, 5)$ satisfy the condition. Hence the answer is $4$.",
