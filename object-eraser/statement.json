  "statement": "Japanese alphabets are often more complex than those of English, thus each of them has multiple \"strokes\". For example, \"depression\" in Japanese is \"\u9b31\" that requires $29$ strokes. \n\nKay has written a sentence in Japanese on his tablet. Now, Kay knows his sentence consists of $N$ characters, and $i$-th character has $A_i$ characters. \n\nHis tablet has a function called \"object eraser\" which enables him to delete the last stroke from the last character. After deleting all the strokes in a single character, the character is completely erased.\n\nHe says he is going to press the object eraser button $K$ times, but is unsure how many characters are going to be completely erased. Tell him the answer.",
  "constraints": "$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}$.\n$0 \\leq K \\leq 10^{12}$.\n$1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^{9}$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$).\n\nApologies for unrealistic constraints (no Japanese character requires as many as $1$ billion strokes in reality).",
