  "statement": "Tokyo is a wonderland of gastronomy.\n\nThere're $N$ sushi places and $M$ ramen places in one area of Tokyo. $i$-th sushi place costs you $A_i$ yen ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$) and $j$-th ramen place costs you $B_j$ yen ($1 \\leq j \\leq M$) (note: yen is a Japanese currency). \n\nYou decided to go to one sushi restaurant for lunch and one ramen restaurant for dinner. Given an integer $K$ ($1 \\leq K \\leq N + M$), output the $K$-th biggest price you're going to spend in total. More formally, output the $K$-th greatest value of $A_i + B_j$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq M$.",
