  "statement": "Given $6$ positive integers $a_{1}$, $b_{1}$, $c_{1}$, $a_{2}$, $b_{2}$, and $c_{2}$, you will think of a function $f(x) = \\frac{a_{1}x^{2} + b_{1}x + c_{1}}{a_{2}x^{2} + b_{2}x + c_{2}}$.\n\nYour task is to find all $x$ such that $f(x)$ is a positive integer. ($x$ is an integer). 0 is not a positive integer.\n\nIt is ensured that $a_{1} \\lt a_{2}$.",
