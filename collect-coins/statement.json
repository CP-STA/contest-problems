  "statement": "You're playing a game that is composed of $n$ rounds. Before starting a game, you have $0$ coin. In $i$-th round, you earn $A[i]$ coins. However, the maximum number of coins you can have is $10$ and minimum is $0$ ($i.e.$ you will not have more than $10$ coins, and you will not have less than $0$ coin). What is the resulting number of coins you have after finishing all $n$ rounds?\n\nNote that, $A[i]$ can be negative: in this case, you lose $A[i]$ coins rather than earning them.",
