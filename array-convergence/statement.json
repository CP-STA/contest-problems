  "statement": "Given an array consisting of $n$ integers $a_{1}$, ..., $a_{n}$, you can do a following operation to each element only once:\nchoose any integer $x$ $(-k \\leq x \\leq k)$ and add $x$ to an element.\n\nAs a result of performing the operations to all the elements in the array, can you make all the elements equivalent?",
  "constraints": "$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{4}$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 2 \u00d7 10^{4}$, $-10^{4} \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{4} (1 \\leq i \\leq n)$.",
  "subtasks": [],
  "input": "The first line of input contains two integers, $n$ and $k$.\nThe second line of input contains $n$ integers that form an array $a$.",
  "output": "Output \"Yes\" if you can make all the elements of $a$ equivalent. Otherwise, output \"No\".",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "5 2\n-1 3 2 2 0",
      "output": "Yes",
      "explanation": "You can create the new array by adding following numbers to each element respectively: $(2, -2, -1, -1, 1)$. As a result of those operations, the new array consists of $1$ only and the goal is achieved. Hence the answer is \"Yes\".\n"
