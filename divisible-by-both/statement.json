  "statement": "Given integers $n$, $a$, $b$, count the number of $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$ such that $i$ is divisible by both $a$ and $b$.\n\nIn the first example, set of $i$ that satisfy the condition are $12$ and $24$. Hence the answer is $2$.\n\nIn the second example, there's no $i$ that satisfy the condition whatsoever. Hence $0$.",
