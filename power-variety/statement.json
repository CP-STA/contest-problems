  "statement": "Given two integers $x$ and $y$, identify the name of the variable that gives the largest value: $a = x^{x}$, $b = y^{y}$, $c = x^{y}$, $d = y^{x}$. If there're multiple largest answers, print $e$ instead of answering with one of the four symbols, $a$, $b$, $c$, or $d$.",
  "constraints": "$1 \\leq x, y \\leq 5 \u00d7 10^{5}$.",
  "subtasks": [],
  "input": "The input contains two integers, $x$ and $y$ in a single line.",
  "output": "Output one alphabetical letter, $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$,or  $e$.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "3 5",
      "output": "b",
      "explanation": "Values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are as follows: $27$, $3125$, $243$, and $125$. Amongst those, $b$ is apparently the largest one and there's no pair that gives identical largest value. Hence the answer is $b$.\n"

      "input": "1 1",
      "output": "e",
      "explanation": "Values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are as follows: $1$, $1$, $1$, and $1$. In this case, $1$ is the largest value but there're multiple answers. Thus, output $e$."
