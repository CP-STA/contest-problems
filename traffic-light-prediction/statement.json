  "statement": "The colour of traffic light in the town of Leveen changes periodically in a following fashion: green \u2192 yellow \u2192 red \u2192 yellow \u2192 green \u2192 yellow \u2192 red \u2192 yellow \u2192 green \u2192 .... The colour turns green at 00:00:00 of each day, and we know that green light lasts for $g$ seconds, yellow light lasts for $y$ seconds, and red light lasts for $r$ seconds. \n\nNow, $t$ seconds have passed since 00:00:00. Your task is to tell which colour is shown in the traffic light at the time of $t$.\n\nIf $t$ is exactly the time when the light turns one from another, output the colour AFTER the change.\n\nNote that, no matter what colour is shown at 23:59:59 in the previous day, the colour turns green at 00:00:00.",

Hence the answer is yellow.\n"
