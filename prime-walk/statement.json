  "statement": "You are given a positive integer, $n$. You start a game on an $x$-axis after receiving this number. \nFirst of all, you are standing on $x = 0$. Starting from $1$, you count the number until $n$. When you are standing at $c$ and count $i$ $(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$, if $i$ is not a prime number, you move rightward (hence you move from $c$ to $c + i$). If $i$ is a prime number, you move leftward (hence you move from $c$ to $c - i$). After completing this game, where will you be?\n\nNote that, $1$ is NOT a prime number.",
