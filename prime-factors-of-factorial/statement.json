  "statement": "You are given a positive integer $n$. Your task is to find prime factors of $n!$. For example, if $n = 3$, you are asked to find the prime factors of $3! = 6$ hence they are $2$ and $3$.\n\nNote that, prime factors of $n$ are the numbers that can divide $n$ without no remainder and are prime numbers.\n\nAlso note that, $n!$ is equal to the product of all numbers smaller than or equal to $n$. For example, $5! = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 = 120$.",
