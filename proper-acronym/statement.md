## Problem Statement 

Kay is struggling with memorising the medical terms he learnt at his clinical workshop. Now he has to remember the term that consists of $n$ words. To facilitate memorisation, Kay generated an acronym of the term, which is given as $s$. Check if $s$ is really a proper acronym of the term.

Note that, acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word.

It is guaranteed that the initial letter of each word is capitalised.

The second line of input contains $n$ words which compose a name of the medical term.
The third line of input conatins a though-to-be proper acronym, $s$.

If $s$ is a proper acronym, output "Yes". Otherwise, output "No".
