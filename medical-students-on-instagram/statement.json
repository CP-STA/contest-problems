  "statement": "There're $N$ students on Instagram in the University. Students are numbered from $1$ to $N$. Kay is curious about how close medical students are with other people in the University on Instagram, so he's going to conduct a brief research, looking at $C$ students from medical school.\n\nMedical students are numbered $P_{1}, ..., P_{C}$. According to the statistics, there're $M$ mutual connections in total, and student $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq M, 1 \\leq x_{i}, y_{i} \\leq N$) are following each other. Considering these connections as a network, Kay defined \"distance\" between two users as the minimal number of connections from one to reach the other. Distance between one user and him/herself is defined $0$.\n\nKay wants to know, for each student $i$ in the University, the minimum possible distance between student $i$ and $m$ ($m \u2208 P$) in the University. If student $i$ is a medical student, output $0$. If there's neither direct nor indirect connection between student $i$ and any medical student, output $-1$.",
  "constraints": "$2 \\leq N \\leq 4 \u00d7 10^{5}$. $1 \\leq M \\leq 10^{5}$.\n\n$1 \\leq C \\leq N$.",

  "input": "The first line of input contains three integers, $N$, $M$, and $C$.\nThe second line contains $C$ numbers, $P_{1}, ..., P_{C}$.\nThen, $M$ lines follow, each of which consists of two integers, $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$.\nIt is guaranteed that one pair of connection appears in the input no more than twice.",
  "output": "Output the answers in a single line, separated by a single space.",

      "input": "10 8 3\n1 9 4\n1 2\n1 7\n3 9\n3 4\n3 6\n4 5\n4 6\n6 8",
      "output": "0 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 0 -1",
      "explanation": "For example, from the perspective of student $8$, distance between him and medical student $1$ can be considered infinitely large. Between $8$ and medical student $9$, the distance is $3$. Between student $8$ and medical student $4$, the distance is $2$. Thus, the answer is $2$ for student $8$.\n"
