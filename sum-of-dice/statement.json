  "statement": "You throw a special programmers' die, which has $6$ faces with $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$ dots, $n$ times. In how many different ways can the sum of all the throws be $s$, for all $s$ from $0$ to $k - 1$? Since the answer can be astronomically large, output the remainder of each number divided by $7340033$.",
